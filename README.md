# MODULE 21 CHALLENGE : Crowdsale Contracts

For this challenge assignment we are working with an aerospace agency to be part of the first human colony on mars. We have been chosen to lead a project to develop a monetary system for the new Mars colony. It is decided to base this new monetary system on blockchain technology, and to define a new cryptocurrency. We will be creating a fungible token (KaseiCoin)that will be ERC-20 compliant, and launch a crowdsale that will allow for those who will be traveling to the colony to convert their money to the new currency. 

The crowdsale contract that we will create will manage the entire crowdsale process, allowing users to send ether to the contract and in return receive KAS, or KaseiCoin tokens. Our contract will mint the tokens automatically and distribute them to buyers in one transaction.

The steps to complete this assignment are as follows; first we need to create the token contract, then the crowdsale contract, then the deployer contract, then deploy the crowdsale to the local blockchain. After deploying the crowdsale to the blockchain we will then make a transaction to test the crowdsale and see if our accounts were able to successfully purchase tokens and if our contract has raised the correct amount of wei.

In this challenge we will be working with Solidity, Solidity is an object-oriented programming language for implementing smart contracts on various blockchain platforms, most notably, Ethereum.

## Technologies

This project utilizes Solidity 0.5.0:

* [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) - This website acts as a workspace where you can write, compile, deploy, and interact with your solidity code.

* [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) - MetaMask is a software cryptocurrency wallet used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to access their Ethereum wallet through a browser extension or mobile app, which can then be used to interact with decentralized applications
